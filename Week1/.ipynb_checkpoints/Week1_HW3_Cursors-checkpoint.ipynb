    "\n",
    "\"A cursor is a data access object that can be used either to iterate through the set of rows in a table or to insert new rows into a table. Cursors have three forms: search, insert, or update. Cursors are commonly used to read and update attributes.\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 types of cursors: Search, Insert, and Update. Search let's you read through a layer's attribute table, Insert let's you add new rows to an attribute table, and Update let's you modify existing data within an attribute. Cursors let you iterate throw each row of the table.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Cursors are for working with vector data (aka shapefiles, feature classes, etc... points, lines, and polygons!). \n",
    "\n",
